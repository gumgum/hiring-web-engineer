- You DON'T need to complete ALL the tests to send them back to use, you can choose and go for quality over quantity. But the more the merrier.
- We recommend you to get (however you like) this folder, so you can send it back to us and we will easily check your changes ;)
- There's no numeration of the test so difficulty its not progressive, so be ready.
- We will use internet-enabled computers while reviewing your work, so don't hesitate to use online resources (as long as they are available for us).
- Please let us know an ETA for your test.
- For bonus points on all tasks:
    + Readable and logically documented code, no need to document each line, but one or two lines in the interesting parts is ok.
